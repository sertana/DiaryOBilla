## What the app does?  

What it does: This is an online diary that you can use to log down what events user attended.
User can enter the venue, the date, and a short description of the event. User can access it later
on to reminiscent what happened during that particular event.

## User Story
John Doe attends various events at various locations. He goes to concerts, sports events, and
other social events. He wants to keep a diary of where, when and a short description of what the
event was like for him. Rather than keep a physical paper journal, he can use this app to write
about the event he went to so that he can read about it later on in time. It does not need to be
an everyday journal, but only of things John finds interesting and exciting that he wants to
remember years down the road.

## Approach Taken
I created an React App. After I started the app. I first set up the created and migrated the database for the events. I then set up the routes, the controller, models and finally the view for the events. I made sure that CRUD was working for the events. 
Once this was established, I introduced auth to the app. Just like with events, I set up the data base and created a relationship between the two tables. Refering to the Auth example, I then set up the model, routes, controller such that an user could create an account, sign in and create posts on his account.
